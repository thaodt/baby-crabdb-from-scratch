# baby-crabdb-from-scratch
Following the charming call of [this book](https://build-your-own.org/database/) and attempt to build my own baby (distributed?) database in Rust.

## To-do lists
- [ ] Indexing: Implement B+-Tree algorithm.
- [ ] Future-work: implement LSM Tree in another branch and finally make a comparison / benchmarks.
